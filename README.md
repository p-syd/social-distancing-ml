# Ultimate Social-Distancing-ml
An attempt to make a model that monitors whether or not social distancing cues are followed. Also, detects if a face-mask is worn or not.





## Technologies
- Python 3.5 (or above)
- OpenCV
- Tensorflow
- Pytorch


## Requirements
 Download COCO trained-model from [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md) and extract it. For this project we have used **"faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco"**. You can change the model depending on your computing resources.
 
## Testing Environment
- Operating System : Ubuntu 18.06 
- Python version : Python 3.5.2
- Tensorflow version : 2.2.0
- OpenCV version : 4.2.0
